# Geneos Include Files

We are making available a suite of example Geneos include files. The goal is to make your life easier and quicker for common configuration tasks. At the moment this is quite limited but we will be adding more content as time goes on. We welcome contributions from our users.

## [Gateway Configuration](gateway/)

Include files that are related to the Gateway's own configuration as opposed to the monitored environment, including some baseline configuration and load monitoring.

## [Legacy Includes](legacy/)

This page contains older, [legacy includes](legacy/) pulled from the last release of the `geneos-utils` archive.
