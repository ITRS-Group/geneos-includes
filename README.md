# geneos-includes
A collection of useful Geneos configuration files and templates

## Legacy include files

The first category we have published is the [legacy includes](legacy/) pulled from the last release of the `geneos-utils` archive.

## Future additions

As we move forward we will begin to publish both ready-to-use include files that can be either downloaded or directly referenced as a URL in the Geneos GSE as well as templates that will serve as a input for automated tools to build useful configurations for both the Gateway and also for Netprobes and maybe other components.
